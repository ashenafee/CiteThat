# CiteThat

## About

CiteThat is a simple tool to help you cite your sources. It is built using **Vue**. With CiteThat, you can look up information on *almost* any paper available through PubMed.

## Background

I created CiteThat after having a job interview where the interviewer brought up **Vue**, but I had no experience in Vue. This tool is the result of me learning Vue.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashenafee/CiteThat.git
cd CiteThat
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    cd CiteThat
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:4000`

3. Enter the PubMed link of the paper you want to cite and click the `Cite` button.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Parse information necessary for citations
- [ ] Allow the user to input their own sources for downloading
